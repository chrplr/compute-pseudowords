* `compute-pseudowords.py` randomly generates 6-letter strings and computes their sublexical statistics (bigram frequencies, quadrigram frequencies, ...) from lexical frequencies in English (subtlex from the British lexicaon project) and French (FreqFilms from Lexique.org).

* `compute-pw6.py`  generates all possible 6-letter strings and computes their sublexical statistics.
